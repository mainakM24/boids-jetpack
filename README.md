# BOIDS
- The **Boids algorithm**, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, simulates flocking behavior in birds and other creatures using three simple rules: separation (avoiding nearby individuals), alignment (matching neighbors' velocities), and cohesion (moving toward the group's center). These rules lead to complex, emergent group movements without direct programming, forming the basis for artificial life and crowd simulation in various applications, from movies and games to urban planning and robotics.
